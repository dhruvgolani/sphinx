            <h3>Abstract</h3>
            Being a chemical engineer (or scientist) involves a life-long quest of learning. In this profession we constantly learn new ideas and try to better ourselves. Our increasing reliance on the digital world means that to succeed we all need to be aware of the latest technology. Computing is an important part of chemical engineering and all chemical engineers are trained to be numerate, IT literate and develop new technologies.
            <br><br>
            In a position paper specifying a particular set of computing competencies that all chemical engineering graduates should possess the main recommendations from the body of the report are as follows: 
           
            <ul class="checboxlist">

            <li>The chemical engineering graduate must have experience in the computer aided acquisition and processing of information. </li>
            <li>It would be desirable for the student to have an appreciation of principles of numerical analysis (including convergence and stability) and non-numeric programming (such as used in artificial intelligence). </li>
            <li>Understand the implementation of elementary algorithms for the numerical solution of engineering problems. </li>
            <li>Be able to solve more sophisticated engineering problems using appropriate applications software.</li>

 <div class="evencon_box">
      <h3>SOME INFORMATION ABOUT THE TRACK STRUCTURE</h3>
      The central line is defined as the <b>middle line</b> in the figures that divides the track into two equal parts. It is labelled as a <b>dotted white line</b> in the figures.
      <b>1)</b> The straight track will be <b>1m</b> in length, marked in <b>the figure above</b>. As can be seen from Figure , the track would be tapered with two trapezoidal tracks combining at the shorter parallel edge to form a single track. The track is divided into 3 regions, and there is also an <b>Extra Region</b> marked in <b>blue</b>, the significance of which will be explained later. The outer width of the track is 160 cm, while the inner width at the intersection is 80 cm. The cars will start from point A on the central line and will try to complete the track. There will be <b>two obstacles</b> in the form of small cylindrical speed breakers (of approximate height 1-2cm), both at distances of 200 cm from the middle intersection line XY of the track. For better understanding of the track structure, refer to the figure <b>above</b>.

		  <div class="evencon_box">
            <h3>PERFORMANCE OF THE MODEL ( OUT OF 70 POINTS)</h3>
            Let <b>L</b> denote the <b>Central length</b> which is the distance travelled by the car along the central line, that is, the component of the length traversed along the central line.
            <br><br>
            Let <b>y</b> denote the <b>Deflection of the car</b> from the central line, in either direction
<b>Perpendicular</b> to the central line.
            <br><br>
            Let the <b>Effective length</b> be defined as the difference between the Central Length and the    Deflection of the car. Mathematically,
            <br><br>
            Effective Length = Central length - Deflection of the Car<br>
                            Effective Length = L – y
            <br><br>
            <b><i> STRAIGHT TRACK –</i></b>
            The track consists of three regions, <b>Region 1, Region 2</b> and <b>Region 3</b>, as marked in the figure below.<br>
            <img src="images/chem_pb2.png" style="width:80%;height:70%;"><br><br>
            As can be seen from the above figure, Region 1 is 375cm long, marked in <b>orange</b>. Region 2 is 25cm long, marked in <b>pink</b> and Region 3 is 400cm, marked in <b>yellow</b>. Thus the total length of the track is 800cm. The Extra region marked in blue is a buffer region for cars that might cross Region 3.
            <br>
            The judging for the three regions is as follows –<br>
            For Region 1 ( Weightage 30 points)<br>
            If the central length covered by the car in this region is L1 cm and the deflection is y1 cm, then the effective length travelled by the car <br>
            Effective Length = L1 – y<br><br>
            Now, the Ideal Length (L’) for Region 1 is 375 cm, as can be seen from the figure. Therefore, the <b>Normalised Score (N1)</b> for Region 1 out of 30 is calculated as-<br>
            N1= (Effective length/375)*30<br><br>
            For Region 2 ( Weightage 10 points)<br>
For Region 2, let the central length be L2 cm. Let y2 cm be the deflection of the car in this region. The effective length for this region will be calculated as follows:<br>
Effective length= L2 - y2/4<br><br>

For Region 3 + Extra Region ( Weightage 30 points)<br><br>

Let the Central Length of the car in Region 3 be L3 cm.<br>
Let the Central Length of the car in the Extra Region be L4 cm.<br><br>

Let the Overall Deflection of the car (for Region 3) measured perpendicular to the central line be y3 cm. The above figure shows how L3 and y3 will be measured if the car stops in Region 3.<br><br>

<u><b>If the car moves on to the Extra Region, then 10 extra points  would be given for crossing the boundary of second region. The deflection won’t be counted  in this region.</b></u><br><br>

The effective length for this region will be calculated as follows.<br>
Effective Length=L3-Y3/3<br>
Now, the Ideal Length for Region 3 is 400 cm from the figure. Therefore,<b>Normalised Score (N3)</b> for this region out of 20 is calculated as- 
N3 = (Effective Length/400)*20<br><br>

The combined Nominal Score (N) out of a total of 70 is given by –<br>
N = N1 + N2 + N3+10(for extra region)<br><br>

            <h3>PRECAUTIONS AND SAFETY MEASURES</h3>
            Each team is required to incorporate appropriate safety measures and equipments in the chemical preparation and ensure that there are no spills, exposures or hazards. Each team is expected to follow the following rules –<br>
           <ul class="checboxlist">
			<li>All containers containing chemicals, like beakers, syringes, and bags must be properly labelled. This includes all the containers holding reactants, intermediates and products. The labels must properly specify the chemical contained and must also have the <b>Chem-e-Mobile Team ID</b> specified. It is the responsibility of the team to carry extra labels if necessary.</li>
      <li>All teams must possess the required personal protective equipment depending on the possible hazards that could be encountered. Equipment may include lab coats, safety glasses, gloves, face shields, and hearing protection.</li>
      <li>If the judge deems the car as <b>unsafe</b>, the team will be disqualified. Hence,every team should try to follow the given characteristics:</li>
      <b>Secure attachments</b>: Chemicals must be securely attached to the car to prevent the container from tipping over during the competition.<br><br>
      <li><b>Pressure related restriction</b>: Pressurized vessels and car components represent a significant explosion hazard due to the substantial energy contained in it. Student teams must demonstrate through appropriate pressure measurements that the pressures during normal operations do not exceed equipment specifications. The following restrictions apply to cars operating under pressure.
      <ul>
        <li><b>Maximum operating pressure</b> - This is the highest pressure within the vessel during normal operation. For initial design purposes, the maximum operating pressure can be estimated from the stoichiometry but the actual pressure must still be measured once the car is operational.</li>
        <li><b>Pressure requirement</b> - If the pressure of your car is greater than 1 psig, then your car should have the following: pressure gauge, emergency relief device (must be in the proper location), pressure certification, proper management system to prevent overcharging.</li>
      </li>
      <li><b>Chemical containment hazard</b>: This applies to any solvent, diluents, reactants, intermediate species or product that is present on your car during operation. Suitable measures must be taken while handling chemicals in the car preparation area to prevent human exposure.</li>
